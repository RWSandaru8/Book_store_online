- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (v15.x or higher)

---

### 1. Project Folder Structure

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Node.js backend files)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (Next.js frontend files)
```

---

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/bookstore
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_books_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```
---

### 3. Install Dependencies

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
## Backend Integration

This frontend connects to a Node.js/Express backend API. Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000 for the application to work correctly.
```

Make sure to adjust the URL if your backend is running on a different port or host.
#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
## Environment Setup

To ensure the application can connect to the backend server properly, create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following content:

```
# Backend API URL - This needs to be NEXT_PUBLIC_ to be accessible in the browser
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Add other environment variables as needed
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
---

### 4. Running the Application

Use two terminals to start both the frontend and backend servers:

#### Terminal 1 â€“ Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### Terminal 2 â€“ Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Shipping & Purchase Flow

1. **Browse Books**: Visitors can click the "Browse Books" button to explore titles.
2. **Signup/Login**: Customers must register or sign in to manage their cart.
3. **Cart Management**: 
   - Add books from search results.
   - Remove books from the cart if needed.
4. **Checkout**:
   - User enters shipping details: address, postal code, and country.
   - Books and quantities are recorded, along with total price.
5. **Order Confirmation**:
   - The system saves checkout history and shipping info.
   - A success message is displayed: "Order placed successfully."
